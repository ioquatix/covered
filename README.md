# Covered [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ioquatix/covered.svg)](hhttps://travis-ci.com/ioquatix/covered)

Covered uses modern Ruby features to generate comprehensive coverage, including support for templates which are compiled into Ruby. **This only works with Ruby 2.6 and its experimental support for RubyVM::AST**

## Motivation

Existing Ruby coverage tools are unable to handle `eval`ed code. This is because the `coverage` module built into Ruby doesn't expose the necessary hooks to capture it. With Ruby 2.6, `RubyVM::AST.parse(source)` came into existence, which gives us a fine-grained tool for computing initial source coverage (i.e. what lines are executable), and thus making it possible to compute coverage for "templates".

It's still tricky to do it correctly, but it is feasible now to compute coverage of web application "views" by using this technique. This gem is an exploration to see what is possible.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

	gem 'covered'

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install covered

## Usage

For `rspec`, simply include the following from your `spec_helper.rb`

```ruby
require 'covered/rspec'
```
